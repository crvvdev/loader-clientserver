# Loader project

Hello, this is a project that i was working on some time ago, as i am not going to use it anytime soon i decided to publish it for free, it's missing some core functionality like streaming "cheats" and some other relevant needed stuff. Anyways, it's a good example and it's helpful to show how to do things in the right tracks.


# Client

It's coded in C++ and it has a graphical interface using Win32 GUI.

 - Metadata gathering (general computer information such as GPU, CPU, OS, Motherboard, Disk drives, Network adapters and some other fingerprints methods)
 - Websocket client connection with server
 - Basic graphical user interface for login and user panel
 - [VMProtect](https://vmpsoft.com/) ready
 - Libraries used: [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp), [OpenSSL 3.0](https://github.com/openssl/openssl/releases/tag/openssl-3.4.0), [JSON for modern C++](https://github.com/nlohmann/json), [scope_guard](https://github.com/Neargye/scope_guard), [ASIO](https://github.com/boostorg/asio)

## Server

It's coded in C#, it's a simple Websocket server.

 - Can be easily configured using toml file (config/config.toml)
 - Logs are automatically saved on disk
 - .NET Core 8.0, so it's portable and work for both Linux and Windows
 - Nu.get packages: Serilog (for logging), Fleck (WebSocket) and Tomlyn (for TOML parsing).
 - Capable of handling version update for client and login
 - Connects to API endpoint to perform actions

## About

This is a sample project with a lot of functionalities stripped, if you're interested in a custom solution that fits your needs please contact me.

Implemented:

 - Versioning, login
 - Server/client networking
 - Metadata gathering
 - Automatically store credentials on disk upon successful login
 - Basic Win32 GUI API (Button, Checkbox, EditBox, ListView, ProgressBar, RichEditControl, Static, StatusBar, Window, Dialog and Thunk)
 - Makes use of solid and secure libraries like OpenSSL
 
 Missing:
 - TLS support (straighforward to be implemented)
 - Network protocol layer security (encrypt communication with strong symmetric encryption like AES)
 - Injection logic (cheat streaming, driver, etc)
 - Other security miscellaneous
 - API endpoint code
 - Some other specific customized solutions
